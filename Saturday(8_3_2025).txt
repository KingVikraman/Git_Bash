*******************************

i) What is git?
----------------
	->Git is a software that is installed in your device, Like Linux and Mac its already
	  preinstalled but if it is windows you got to manually install it. 

ii)Is git important to know?
-----------------------------
	-> Yes, git is really important cause otherwise you are not going to be successful at
	    at programming or even coding, there is terminal and there is git both are equally-
	    important for a programmer.

iii) Why is git very important?
--------------------------------
	-> Git is a memory card for code. Lets say if you got a code no matter what it is, 
	   Jave, C++, HTML, phython, whatever it is you would want to save its progress as
	   you update your code along the way to have like a history. In that way if you
	   die or whatnot, you wont lose you shit(progress), you would have it stored somewhere
	   for another person to pick up where you have left.

iv)Git Commands!
-----------------
	-> Git Status [Check the status of your work tree]
	-> Git init [initialise your git, its like inserting a memory card to save your work]
	-> Git add . [To add the files that i want to save]

	-> Git commit -m " (message) "< the message that you wanna commit.
		    ^
		the command
	-> Git log [see the history, or seeing you saved changes].
	-> Git checkout [this one i am really unsure on how to explain but its like 
			  for some sort of reason it can bring you back to your 
			  previous progress].
	-> Git branch [this command helps you make changes in a way where you dont effect
			the main reposotory].
	-> Git remote add origin https:// gitHub.com/
	-> Git push [TO push you saved work to where ever your repository is].
